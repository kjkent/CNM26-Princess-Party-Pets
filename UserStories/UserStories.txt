Epic

As a busy parent, I want to be able to quickly and easliy arrange party activities 
for my child. 

This epic is split into three user stories;

1. As a parent I want to find a cat to match the party of my child's chosen theme. 

2. As a user I want to choose from a cat/party that will fit my price range to 
ensure that I can afford a party for my child.

3. As a user I want to be able to order my selected party level and accessories
in one easy checkout to save time.
